# Software Development Agreement

`Purpose` This template is for the creation of an agreement where a contractor creates software for a customer. This template covers only the _creation_ of the software.

If ongoing support, maintainance or training related to the software will be required, contractor and customer should create an additional service agreement.

`Party 1 Name` Contractor

`Party 2 Name` Customer

`Jurisdiction` Australia

## Agreement Duration

Software development is usually:

- work done according to a "work scope" (work description); or
- continuous ad-hoc work.

If you're doing the first kind of work, make sure you have a Work Scope - you can mkae it part of the Agreement by just mentioning it in the right way.

## Payment Methods

There are a lot of ways that a contractor can get paid for software development work, and some are better suited to the nature of the work than others.  Larger projects tend to benefit from the "milestone" payments approach, which stages payments to manage risk for both parties.  For smaller jobs, it's usually fine to take a "pay some up front and the rest at the end approach".

## Out of scope work

In software development, it's not at all uncommon for a customer to have new ideas about what they want in the software product after development work has already started. There needs to be way to determine how the Contractor gets paid this work if it's additional.
