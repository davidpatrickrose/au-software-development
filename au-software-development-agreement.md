# Software Development Agreement

`Purpose` This template is for the creation of an agreement in which a Contractor will create software for a Customer. This template covers only the _creation_ of the software. If ongoing support, maintainance or training related to the software will be required, Contractor and Customer should create an additional service agreement.

`Party 1 Name` Contractor

`Party 2 Name` Customer

`Jurisdiction` Australia

## Agreement Duration

## Work Scope

The _specification_ of the software that Contractor will develop for Customer is usually a purely commercial document, so there's a limit to how much CodePact can help you with it. It's simplest just to incorporate the software specification into this agreement by refering to it.

### Work Scope

Contractor will develop software to meet the software specifications in the Work Scope.

## Inconsistency with Work Scope

## Acceptance Testing

Generally speaking, it's a good idea for Contractor and Customer to agree on how they will determine that the software meets the software specifications laid out in the Work Scope. This is usually called acceptance testing.

### Acceptance Testing

Contractor and Customer will determine if the Software meets the Software Specification by using the testing process in {{testing document}}

## Payment Calculation

## Payment Methods

For a software development agreement, it's probably a good idea to look at your acceptance testing document to determine the most sensible way to pay the Contractor.

If the software product is simple enough that both parties are happy to only have one set of acceptance tests, the third option for payment is probably a good idea.

If there are multiple sets of acceptance tests over time, it's probably best to make passing each of these tests a milestone and to use the fourth payment option below.

## Out of scope work

In software development, it's not at all uncommon for a customer to have new ideas about what they want in the software product after development work has already started. There needs to be way to determine how the Contractor gets paid for this additional work.
