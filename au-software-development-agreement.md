# Software Development Agreement

`Purpose` This template is for the creation of an agreement where a contractor creates software for a customer. This template covers only the _creation_ of the software.

If ongoing support, maintainance or training related to the software will be required, contractor and customer should create an additional service agreement.

`Party 1 Name` Contractor

`Party 2 Name` Customer

`Jurisdiction` Australia

## Agreement Duration

Software development is usually:

- work done according to a "work scope" (work description); or
- continuous ad-hoc work.

If you're doing the first kind of work, make sure you have a Work Scope - you can mkae it part of the Agreement by just mentioning it in the right way.

## Out of scope work

In software development, it's not at all uncommon for a customer to have new ideas about what they want in the software product after development work has already started. There needs to be way to determine how the Contractor gets paid for this additional work.
